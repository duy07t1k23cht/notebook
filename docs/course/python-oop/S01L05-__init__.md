# Python `__init__`

!!! warning
    The `__init__` method doesn't create the object but only initializes the object's attributes. Hence, **the `__init__()` is not a constructor**.

!!! abstract "Summary"

    - Use the `__init__()` method to initialize the object's attributes.
    - The `__init__()` doesn't create an object but is automatically called after the object is created.
