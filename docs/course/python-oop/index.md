!!! abstract
    By the end of this Python OOP module, we'll have good knowledge of object-oriented principles. And we’ll know how to use Python syntax to create reliable and robust software applications.

    What we’ll learn:

    - Create objects in Python by defining classes and methods.
    - Extend classes using inheritance.
    - SOLID principles in object-oriented programming.

!!! warning "Alert"
    Some of the OOP concepts introduced in the original source are already familiar to me, so I might skip those in this course. The bottom line is that this is my notebook, not a textbook.
