# Python Methods

!!! abstract "Sumarry"

    - A method is a function that is bound to an instance of a class.
    - A method is an instance of the `method` class
    - A method has the first argument (`self`) as the object to which it is bound.
    - Python automatically passes the bound object to the method as the first argument. By convention, its name is `self`.
