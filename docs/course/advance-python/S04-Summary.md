# Section 4. Decimal

!!! abstract "Summary"
    - Use the Python `decimal` module when you want to support fast correctly-rounded decimal floating-point arithmetic.
    - Use the `Decimal` class from the `decimal` module to create Decimal object from strings, integers, and tuples.
    - The `Decimal` numbers have a context that controls the precision and rounding mechanism.
    - The `Decimal` class doesn’t have all methods defined in the `math` module. However, you should use the Decimal’s arithmetic methods if they’re available.
